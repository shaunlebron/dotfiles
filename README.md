Dot Files
=========

These are dot files that configure my terminal environment.  They
are as important as the code that I write, so it is worth saving.

To recover:
```
ln -s bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s screenrc ~/.screenrc
ln -s tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
ln -s ctags ~/.ctags
```

Comments are placed where appropriate, except ctags doesn't allow them:
